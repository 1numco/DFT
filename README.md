# DFT
There are two scripts: one generate signal, which is the sum of a random number of harmonics with random weights, and one make Discrete Fourier Transform any signal. 
DFT.py read point for transform from input.txt and write obtained points to output.txt.
Also there are two files and two pictures. They consist input and output dataset for DFT (pictures are graphs input and output data).
If you would like to use my dataset, then you must change name of file "input" in line 28 to "input_1".
If you would like to use your dataset, then create file with name "input", and put impulse duration as first value and rest values must be signal values.
If you would like to check my generator of signal, then run this script and thereafter run DFT.py without changing.
